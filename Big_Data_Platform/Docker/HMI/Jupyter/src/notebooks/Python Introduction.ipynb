    "\n",
    "\"Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open-source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.\"[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))\n",

    "To start out in python you can use a python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or just create your own notebooks on this server. "
