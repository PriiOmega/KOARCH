# KOARCH

Development of a reference architecture for machine optimization based on computational intelligence and big data.

Conventional manufacturing plants reach their limits due to dynamic developments on the global markets, increasing product variety and complexity as well as continuously increasing requirements on system software.Computational intelligence methods promise flexible adaption and extension of the plants, while being able to automatically detect invalid system states, applying condition monitoring and predictive control and maintenance. Additionally, consumption of resources, i.e. time and energy, can be optimized. However, the integration of suitable solutions in companies often fails.In the KOARCH project (Cognitive Architecture for Cyber-Physical Production systems and Industry 4.0) researchers from the inIT, IDE+A, Computer Science together with three partners from industry develop solutions for these problems. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is convinced of the capabilities and supports the project in total with about 1.5 million Euro.The main goal of KOARCH is to minimize the manual effort to make computational intelligence methods available to the industry. Therefore, generic approaches from data acquisition and modelling up to the generation of operation instructions are combined in an architectural manner. The required technologies are already available, but not yet capable of the required collaboration.
